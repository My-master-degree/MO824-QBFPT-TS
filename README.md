# TS QBFPT 

This is the source code from one of the [MO824](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2019/1/S/P/IC/MO824) course activities. 
This repository contains an implementation of a Java 1.8 code using Gurobi as solver and Eclipse as IDE for the Tabu Search (TS) for the QBFPT (Quadratic Binary Function Problem with Triplet constraint).
The project file structure works as follows:

* instances: Contains some QBFPT instances;
* output: Contains the experiments output.
* src: Source code.
